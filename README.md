# Module 7 | Assignment - Employee Database

# Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
In this project, Bobby wants to determine retiring employees with their titles and search for specific employees for mentorship training. This is called the 'silver tsunami," in which many employees will be retired at approximately the same time. The point is here based on the retirements, and the company needs more hiring and wants to know which sections what kinds of title (type of employees) will be refilled soon. The company is also looking at the possibility of mentorship since some employees who will be retired could be wok as mento for next generations.



# Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

1. From the table, as shown below, we knew that each title section had a different amount of retiring employees, especially Senior levels had more people who would be retiring very soon.

# Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

# How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

In the 'silver tsunami,' after people in the retired list retire, the company needs to hire many new employees for these seven different job tiles. Especially the shortage in Senior staff will be the highest-numbered, in which 23911 employees will retire soon, followed by Senior engineer sections with 87374 employees and so on, as shown in table 1. The total number of employees ready to retire is 52309, among seven different titles.

# Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
The eligibility of being a mentor for the next generation among the retirement-ready employees is 1549 in total. It means there are enough ready-retirement employees who can mentor the next generation. Looking at retired and mentor-able employees, we found enough mentors among ready-retired people except for the manager section. There is no refill for the manager's mentor's position, with only 2 for the retirements list.
